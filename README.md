Running with Data | MSDS Practicum II
Can I use my Garmin data to help me achieve and predict my personal best for upcoming races? As a marathon runner, I am always trying to reach new personal bests for race times, with the ultimate goal being able to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Other runners have these same goals, so wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you can not only track your data via your smart device, but then perform machine learning to achieve optimal performance? My goal with this research is to help educate myself and others on ways to improve performance by predicating my personal best times and utilizing data to its optimal advantage.
